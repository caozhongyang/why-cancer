# why-cancer
Please forgive me for wanting to build such a project a long time ago, because my stupidity led to the fact that I didn't start until I knew that my grandfather had cancer. This project is used to analyze cancer from the perspective of a programmer. If the project can achieve something, I hope it can help more people.

## Why is it a programmer who does this?
Programmers are usually more sensitive to mathematics. For example, the process of DNA replication looks like an encryption process.

## Subject
This project requires many topics waiting for us to explore and analyze, I would like to analyze it step by step from the shallow to the deep, and divide the topics into the following
### Human
### Disease
### Cancer
